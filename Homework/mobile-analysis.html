            <h1>Mobile Browsing - Analysis </h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <!-- ***********************************************
Outline what you were asked to do and how well you completed the assignment.
You may want to review the questions you were asked to consider.  If you need more than one paragraph just add another by adding the opening and closing paragraph tags...like this: <p>new paragraph text here</p>
************************************************* -->
            <p>In this project I was asked to spend 24 hours only using my phone, to do my regular browsing and things I would normally do. I took the challenge and here are the results that I have found.  </p>
            
            <h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
                <li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
                <li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
                <li>Any frustrations?</li>
                <li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <!-- for each question give your general experience, and then give a specific example of a site that you though did a good or bad job with this.  Do not use the same site for all examples! -->
            <h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
            <p>I found that for someone who generally uses their phone for most things, I was able to see all the things that I was looking for. One thing that I was a little worried about was checking my emails through my phone's browser. But it turned out I was able to see everything I needed to successfully use my email.</p>
            <h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
            <p>I was quite happy with the success that I had while using my phone to browse for things. Any news story that I looked up, or other sort of article was quite easy to find and was presented in a easy to use view.</p>
            <h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
            <p>I was able to do everything I set out for. The internet has evolved in such a way that using mobile browsers is not as big of a pain as it was 5 years ago. It also is constantly getting better, so we can expect in the future to see even more ease of use.</p>
            <h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
            <p>Probably the biggest frustration was just the fact, that my brain was programmed for certain websites to be used on a computer rather than a mobile view. For example, when I used facebook on my phone's browser for the first time, it took a little getting used too, but after the second time I was able to do anything I could do on my computer.</p>
            <h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
            <p>Most of the time I found that things worked generally the same. I would proably judge wether I would look at something on a computer or a phone, on the ease of accessing it, rather than how it looks.</p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I learned that when you are programming a website and considereding how to design it, keeping in mind a mobile view is a key component for a successful website. People could view your site in many diffrent ways and so catering to that thought is important. </p>
            
            <h2>List of sites</h2>
            <!-- list out the sites you used as examples above.  The href="" portion is where you will put the URL to the site.  In between the <a></a> is where you will put the clickable text the use will see.  The first link to Google is given as an example...you should change it to one of your links. -->
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Google</a></li>
                <li><a href="" target="_blank">Name of site</a></li>
