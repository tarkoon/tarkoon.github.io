            <h3>O Captain! My Captain!</h3>
        <p>O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,</p>
        <p>The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won, </p>
        <p>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting, </p>
        <p>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring; </p>
        <blockquote> But O heart! heart! heart! </blockquote>
        <blockquote> O the bleeding drops of red, </blockquote>
        <blockquote>  Where on the deck my Captain lies, </blockquote>
        <blockquote>Fallen cold and dead. </blockquote>
        <br>
        <p>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells; </p>
        <p>Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills, </p>
        <p>For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding, </p>
        <p>For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning; </p>
        <blockquote>Here Captain! dear father!</blockquote>
        <blockquote>This arm beneath your head!</blockquote>
        <blockquote>It is some dream that on the deck,</blockquote>
        <blockquote>You’ve fallen cold and dead.</blockquote>
        <br>
        <p>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still, </p>
        <p>My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will, </p>
        <p>The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done, </p>
        <p>From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won; </p>
        <blockquote>Exult O shores, and ring O bells!</blockquote>
        <blockquote>But I with mournful tread,</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Walk the deck my Captain lies,</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Fallen cold and dead.</blockquote>
