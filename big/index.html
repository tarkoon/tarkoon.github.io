                    This Site is designed to showcase the incredible detail and thought that went behind one of my favorite movies, Lord of the Rings. In order to do so, it takes the point of view of a travel guide, where you can take a look at some of the different places that are in Middle Earth. Ranging from a list of places that have the best food, to places where you can find the most dangerous adventures, this site will provide you with the best possible experience you can have, while exploring the wonders and Middle Earth.

                    This site will be targeting individuals who are interested in the Lord of The Rings series and The Hobbit. But to help the development process, I have decided to make a fake use of the site and a persona to go along with it.

                    Meet Bilbo Baggins. After going on a quest to defeat the dragon Smaug and reclaim the Dwarves Kingdom, Bilbo Baggins has returned home. Now heâ€™s thirsting for adventure again, and needs to know where the best place to travel in Middle Earth is. Thankfully, he has access to a site that will help him to find the perfect place for him to go.
